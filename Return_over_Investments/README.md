# Machine Learning Model for Investment Returns

Any financial institution works with investment returns when putting together its investment portfolios that will be offered to clients. These investment 
portfolios are usually "baskets" containing stocks and other financial instruments. The return on investment of the portfolio will be directly proportional
to the individual yield of the products that make it up.

Financial institutions have complex systems that simulate various investment scenarios with various products and seek to offer the one with the highest 
return rate for the institution. Building such a system is a complex task that involves the analysis of many variables.

But to make our work easier, the R language offers an excellent package called "PortfolioAnalytics," developed by Brian Peterson of the University of 
Washington in the United States. This package contains several ready-to-use functions based on Machine Learning algorithms that perform all the work of 
portfolio analysis, simulate scenarios, and calculate the return rate of investment portfolios.

In this project, you will find a complete portfolio analysis procedure and investment return calculation with a portfolio consisting of stocks of large
companies listed on the American stock exchange.
