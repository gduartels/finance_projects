# Analysis to Predict the Strength of the Brazilian Real Compared to Other Currencies

This project, built in the R language, aims to make predictions of the strength of the Brazilian currency, the Real, compared to other currencies and the price of commodities (such as oil, wheat, etc...).

There are two input datasets. One with the exchange rates of five currencies over a period of time, and another with the prices of commodities over the same period of time.

The final result is the forecast of the evolution of the performance of the Real compared to other currencies, and this is done using different predictive models and comparing the prediction performance of these models, as shown in the graph below.
