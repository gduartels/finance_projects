# Finance Projects

Welcome to my finance project repository! Here you will find a collection of projects I have been developing to explore different areas of the financial world, including currency forecasting, portfolio optimization, and machine learning models for investments.

The project _Forex_BRL_ is an analysis to predict the strength of the Brazilian Real against other currencies, built in R language and using two input datasets: one with the quotation of 5 currencies during a period of time, and another with the price of commodities in the same period of time.

The project _Portfolio_Optimization_Python_ is a Python portfolio optimization cookbook, which presents a variety of techniques for building efficient portfolios. You will learn how to apply portfolio optimization models, including the Efficient Frontier, and explore different asset allocation strategies.

The project _Portfolio_Optimization_Shiny_ is a Shiny app for portfolio optimization using the Mean-Variance model in R, which offers a simple and efficient approach to building diversified portfolios. This app displays percentages to be allocated to each asset class and uses the Black-Litterman model to combine investors' opinions on asset classes in the portfolio optimization model.

The projecy _Return_over_Investments_ is a machine learning model for investment returns. This model uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyze and simulate investment scenarios, calculating the rate of return on investment portfolios formed by shares of large companies listed on the American stock exchange.

All projects feature line-by-line commented scripts, making them easily adjustable and customizable for your own use. I hope these projects can be useful for your journey in the finance area and I am available for any questions or suggestions.
