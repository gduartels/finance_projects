# Implementing an Analytical Model for Portfolio Analysis

This is an RStudio Shiny application that builds efficient portfolios based on a simple mean-variance model and a Black-Litterman model (unfinished module). 
The application displays percentages to be allocated to each asset class.

The Black-Litterman model combines investors' views on asset classes in the portfolio optimization model, being widely used in Hedge Funds with portfolios
worth billions of dollars.

For this application, we considered American assets, as it is easier to find documentation on such assets.
